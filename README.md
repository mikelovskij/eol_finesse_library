# eol_finesse_library
some useful functions to generate .kat scripts for the study of a triangular cavity matching.

## Installation guide: 
* Clone or download and Unzip this repository wherever you please.

* Install the package in your favourite python 3.6 (possibly virtual) environment. I suggest to install it in develop / editable mode so that if you want to edit some plotting or other function you can do that without having to uninstall and reinstall the package. In order to do this just run: 

``` python /path/to/mypackage/setup.py develop```

or

``` pip install -e /path/to/mypackage```


* **Note:** the setupt might automatically install some required dependencies (last versions of matplotlib, numpy and ipympl) in your environment if not alreay present.
